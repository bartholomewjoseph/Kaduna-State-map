## Project Description
An analysis of population data in Kaduna State, Nigeria. i imported a gridded population raster and processed it to create a visually informative map. By applying classification techniques, i categorized the population density into distinct classes, revealing distribution patterns and hotspots across the state. To gain deeper insights, you conducted zonal statistics within ward and settlement boundaries in the southeastern region. This allowed me to calculate various population metrics for each ward, such as population count and density. The results were organized in a table and exported to Excel format for further analysis and sharing. The combination of geospatial analysis techniques including classification, zonal statistics, and export to tabular format, provided valuable information on population dynamics and characteristics. This analysis can support evidence-based decision-making in various areas, such as healthcare planning, infrastructure development, and targeted social programs, ultimately benefiting the well-being of the local population."
